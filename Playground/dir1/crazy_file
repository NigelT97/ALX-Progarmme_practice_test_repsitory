my math teacher is o'level was the best
however my math teacher in a'level was the worst
in varsity i studied mathematics due to my love of math
but mathematics is very difficult
a lot dropped out of varsity because of it
at the end i was able to pass with a first class
math is still the best thing i did
may it not be mistaken for the drug kkk
i am a mathematician
